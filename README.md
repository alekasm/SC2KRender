This program is designed to read SimCity 2000 files (.sc2) and display them using DirectX11. Both SimCopter and Streets of SimCity are 3D Maxis games released in the late 90s which immerses players in their SimCity 2000 maps. Expect this project to take a pretty long time, especially when it comes to recreating models.
